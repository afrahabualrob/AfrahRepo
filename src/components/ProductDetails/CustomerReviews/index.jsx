          Millions of Americans turn to Lasik Surgery when their vision is less
          than perfect and theyâ€™re tired of being tied down to wearing glasses
          or contacts. What part of the eye is it that may be causing all your
          vision trouble? Your cornea! When the shape of your cornea is
          irregular, the image on your retina is blurry and out-of-focus. The
          cornea is a part of your eye that works to focus light and projects an
          image on the retina. This focusing of light is called refraction. The
          3 main types of refractive errors are myopia (nearsightedness),
          hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism.{" "}
